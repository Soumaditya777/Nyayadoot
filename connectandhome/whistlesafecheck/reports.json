Uzbekistan should guarantee rights to personal security, privacy, and nondiscrimination by decriminalizing consensual sexual conduct between men.\r\n\r\nUzbekistan, a current member of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council, has undertaken key human rights reforms since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev came to power in 2016, but the criminalization of same-sex sexual conduct remains a significant stain on Tashkent\u2019s record. Article 120 of the current criminal code punishes consensual sexual conduct between men with up to three years in prison.\r\n\r\n\u201cArticle 120, and abuses linked to it, has placed gay and bisexual men in Uzbekistan in a deeply vulnerable and marginalized position, leaving them with almost no protection from harassment by police and others,\u201d said Hugh Williamson, director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. \u201cUzbekistan should definitively turn a page from its abusive past and remove this rights-violating and outdated provision from its new Criminal Code.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed nine gay men and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activists and reviewed other material, such as videos depicting and encouraging humiliation, insults, beatings, or sexual abuse of gay men that were posted online and in homophobic social media groups, such as TashGangs. The men interviewed, who asked to remain anonymous, said that they faced arbitrary arrests, threats, extortion, psychological pressure, and physical attacks by both police and non-state actors for being gay.",
