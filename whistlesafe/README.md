# WhistleSafe - Anonymous Reporting Platform

WhistleSafe is a secure platform for anonymously reporting corruption or injustice. It uses AI-powered analysis to assess report credibility and detect patterns while protecting the whistleblower's identity.

- **Metadata stripping**: Guidance for removing identifying file metadata

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
- Simulated NLP analysis (would integrate with actual API in production)
- LocalStorage for demo purposes (would use secure backend in production)
- Responsive design for all devices
